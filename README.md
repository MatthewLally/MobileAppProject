## Project Brief
This Repository contains the code for 3rd Year Software Development Project for my module Mobile Applications Development. The lecturer is Damien Costello.
The project brief is :
Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated Storage and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices.  
These include:  
- Accelerometer or Gyroscope 
- GPS (Location Based Services) 
- Sound 
- Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc) 
- Camera 
- Multi Touch Gesture Management 

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose and an answer to the question 

> “why will the user open this app for a second time?” 

## What is my project?
My Project is a guide to the soccer teams in Galway city and county. I have information on the teams currently playing in the five leagues of junior soccer in Galway in my application. Using Location services I added a button that the user can click to view their current location and the quickest driving route to the selected club. I also provided a link to each clubs website or facebook page which have more information about the clubs. Using an SQLite database, I have a page on my application where the user can add a player to the database and include such details as his club name, and his position. This player can later be edited or deleted. I believe my application answers the question of why will the user open the application for a second time as it contains so much information which may prove useful if the user ever needs to travel to one of these clubs.

## Project Design
My Project was designed using a split view which has the tabs on the left hand side of the application, from here the user can chose the tab they wish to navigate too.

## Conclusion
Overall I feel I greatly improved my knowledge of C# throughout the project. I feel I am now a far superior windows universal app developer compared to when I started the project.

## Submission
My appliction is currently up for certification on the windows store which should be completed soon. My Developer name is Matthew Lally and the application name is Galway Soccer Guide.
